# Sion Jones

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Sion Jones**, author of *Offerings for Arianrhod*, *The Wakeful Cup*, and other works of magical realism, surreal satire, and quiet hauntings.

This repository powers [sjones.aethempress.com](https://sjones.aethempress.com), the permanent home of my author site. You’ll find links to:

- 📚 My short fiction (some available through Kindle Unlimited)
- 🕯️ My Substack, *The Wakeful Cup*, where stories steep slowly
- 🖋️ Notes, lore, and other strange ephemera
- 📂 ARC opportunities & digital handouts (via GitHub and Substack)
- 🔗 Long-term mirrors of selected works (hosted as Markdown & PDFs)

### About Me

I write fiction that lives at the edge of the ordinary: dreams that spill into daylight, memories you can eat, and bus routes that change more than your destination. If you like **Edward Hopper with ghosts**, or **Murakami if he worked at a Waffle House**, we’ll probably get along just fine.

### Highlights

- 🌓 *Offerings for Arianrhod* — a lyrical, layered novel of grief, memory, and myth
- ☕ *The Wakeful Cup* — short story & Substack series exploring fate and dreams
- 🪞 *The Diner at the Edge of What Happened* — a collection of surreal, character-driven short stories (coming soon)
